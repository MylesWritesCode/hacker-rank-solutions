# 30 days of code
Following [HackerRank's 30 Days of Code](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code), but just doing each project sequentially without limitations to days. I remember most of my C++, so many of these will just be a review for me.

## How I'm running
I'm just using GCC to compile my code, then inputting the test inputs. Rather than write some test harness and modules, I'm opting to just use the console as input to ensure that I'm getting data from the user correctly.

```
g++ -g -o2 -std=c++2a -o bin/<output-name> <filename>
```
